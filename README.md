## AWS Cloud Architecture Document for Learning Management System (LMS)

---

### 1. Scope
This document outlines the AWS cloud architecture for a Learning Management System (LMS) that delivers high-quality web development and cloud computing courses. The system supports a wide variety of content formats—images, text, and video—across different delivery models including self-paced, live, and on-demand learning. The architecture ensures high availability, performance, reliability, and scalability using AWS best practices.

---

### 2. Objectives
- Provide global access to learning content with low latency and high performance.
- Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- Deliver a scalable solution that adjusts to demand.
- Protect user data and ensure platform security.
- Simplify system management and enable automation through infrastructure as code.
- Support varied content delivery models: self-paced, live, and on-demand.

---

### 3. Functional Requirements
- User Registration and Authentication (Students, Teachers, Admins)
- Content Management System (CMS) for uploading and editing courses
- Video Streaming (Live and Recorded Sessions)
- Quiz and Assessment Engine
- Progress Tracking and Reporting
- Real-Time Notifications (Email/SMS)
- Dashboard with Analytics for Admins and Instructors
- Role-Based Access Control

---

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Low-latency content delivery using CDN and edge caching.
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling for application and database layers.
- **Availability:** 99.99% uptime using Multi-AZ deployments.
- **Reliability:** Automated backups and disaster recovery.
- **Security:** IAM roles, KMS encryption, VPC isolation, and HTTPS.
- **Maintainability:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
- **Monitoring:** Centralized logging, alarms, and distributed tracing using CloudWatch and X-Ray.

### 6. Architecture Diagrams

#### 6.1 High-Level System Architecture
- Clients (Browser/Mobile)
- Amazon CloudFront (CDN)
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- ECS Cluster running Node.js backend or Lambda functions
- RDS for relational data
- DynamoDB for course metadata and quick access content
- S3 for media and document storage
- Amazon IVS or MediaLive for live streaming
- Amazon Cognito for authentication
- CloudWatch for monitoring and logging

#### 6.2 Content Delivery Flow
- Course content uploaded to S3
- CloudFront distributes static assets globally
- Video content streamed via Amazon IVS or MediaStore
- Database interaction via REST/GraphQL APIs hosted on ECS or Lambda

#### 6.3 CI/CD Pipeline
- Source Code on GitHub/CodeCommit
- CodePipeline triggers build and test via CodeBuild
- CodeDeploy deploys to ECS or Lambda
- Automated rollback and approval workflows

#### 6.4 Authentication & Authorization Flow
- User signs up/signs in via Cognito
- JWT token issued and passed to frontend
- Backend validates token for API access
- Role-based access determined via Cognito groups
